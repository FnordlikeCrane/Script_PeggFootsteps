# Peggy Footsteps
**_An add-on for the indie game Blockland._**

This add-on enables footstep sound effects that play when the users walk.
It also includes sound effects for jumping, and different noises based on the speed of the player. 
The main feature of this add-on that sets it apart from other footstep add-ons is that the sound effects that play change based on the color of the bricks you step on. (e.g. stepping on green bricks plays grass footsteps)
